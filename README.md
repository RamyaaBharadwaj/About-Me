## 💡 Fun Facts About Me
- Anime has been a part of my life since grade 4 — so if you need recommendations, I'm your go-to! But please, don’t ask me to speak Japanese. My skills are limited to anime phrases and a lot of "Nani?!". 😂🎬
- I’m a crochet enthusiast! It’s my ultimate way to unwind, find peace, and create something beautiful while the world around me gets chaotic. 🧶🌼
- Tech, anime, and crochet — that’s my happy trifecta. If you want to chat about any of those (or all three), let’s grab a virtual coffee! ☕👾
